"""Determinism screen for R1CS constraint systems.

Answers one question: given the circuit's declared inputs, is every declared
output forced to a single value by the constraints?

If not, a malicious prover may be able to choose an output -- the
under-constrained-circuit bug class, which is the one that matters and the one
differential testing cannot find (see docs/CIRCUIT_TESTING.md).

The analysis is sound in the direction that counts: a signal reported
DETERMINED really is forced. It is incomplete in the other direction -- it
propagates only through constraints that are linear in the remaining unknowns,
so it reports false positives on gadgets whose uniqueness needs case analysis
(IsZero being the canonical one). Treat UNDETERMINED as "look at this", not as
"this is broken". It is a screen, not a prover.

Input format (JSON):

    {
      "prime": "218882428718392752...",   # optional, defaults to BN254 scalar
      "signals": ["one", "in", "out", ...],
      "inputs":  [1],                     # indices; signal 0 is always the constant 1
      "outputs": [2],
      "constraints": [
        {"a": {"1": 1}, "b": {"3": 1}, "c": {"0": 1, "2": -1}}
      ]
    }

Each constraint means (A . w) * (B . w) = (C . w), where A, B, C are sparse
linear combinations over the witness vector w and w[0] == 1.

    Rules, all of which preserve soundness:

      1. If both A and B are fully known, (A.w)(B.w) is a fixed field element,
         so the constraint is linear in C. One unknown in C with a nonzero
         constant coefficient is therefore forced.

      2. If exactly one of A, B is fully known -- say A, with value alpha --
         the constraint reads alpha*(B.w) = C.w, linear in the unknowns of
         B and C together. It forces a signal only when that signal's
         coefficient is a nonzero *constant*:
           - an unknown appearing only in C has coefficient -C[s]: always safe;
           - an unknown appearing in B has coefficient alpha*B[s] - C[s],
             which depends on alpha. Safe only when A is a compile-time
             constant, so alpha is known at analysis time rather than at
             witness time.
         This distinction is the whole reason `in * out === 0` does not let us
         conclude anything about `out`: the coefficient is `in`, which is zero
         for one of the inputs the prover may choose.

      3. If both A and B carry unknowns the constraint is genuinely quadratic
         in them, and linear propagation says nothing.
